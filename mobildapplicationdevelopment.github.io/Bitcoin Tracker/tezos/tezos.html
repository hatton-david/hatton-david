              <h3>
                Tezos is a technology for deploying a blockchain capable of modifying its own set of rules with minimal disruption to the network through an on-chain governance model.

Unlike blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, in its most popular incarnation, a Tezos blockchain does not rely on mining (Proof of Work), but instead utilizes a Proof-of-Stake based consensus model.

In August 2014, the project's founders released a paper called the "Position Paper", and in September of the same year the Tezos whitepaper was released.

In 2017, the Tezos Foundation, a Switzerland based non-profit, raised $232 million in a fundraiser and became one of the biggest ICOs at that moment.
