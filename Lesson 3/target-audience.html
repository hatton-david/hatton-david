        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <p>The target audience for this website would be people who love to either have people over
      or go to places where outdoor food cooking activities are planned. It gives them a place to check weather
      conditions before the activity is scheduled. The website will ultamatly tell them whether it would
      be a good idea to have the activity on that day, or plan for another.</p><br>
      <h4>Many scenarios could present themselves to make this website useful to my target audience.</h4>
      <p>- That pony ride at your daughters birthday party would not be ideal when everyone is sopping wet.</p>
      <p>- Bad weather would certainly dampen the mood when you are camping with your friends on spring break.</p>
      <p>- Friendly games of football or soccer would be much more difficult when you are covered in mud.</p>
      <p>- You will know when to put chains on those tires in preperation for the snow.</p>
      <p>- You won't get struck by lightning while you are on vacation swimming in the ocean when a storm rolls in.</p><br>
      <h3>Here we se a civilized party, properly prepared for the weather.</h3>
